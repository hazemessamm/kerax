Deep Learning library based on JAX and inspired from Keras



---
> Task List
- [ ] Add more layers
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add loss functions
- [ ] Add more optimizers 
---

Example:
```python
from layers import core
import models
from layers import convolutional as c
import numpy as np
from jax import numpy as jnp
from optimizers import optimizers
from utils import to_categorical
from jax.scipy.special import logsumexp
from jax import nn
```
